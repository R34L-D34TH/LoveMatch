<h3 class="para"><a name="where-this-applies"></a> 2. Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h3>
<p class="para">This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the LoveMatch brand. 
    For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</p>
<p class="para">Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.</p>
<h3 class="para"><a name="information-we-collect"></a> 3. Information We Collect</h3>
<p class="para">It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people 
    you’d like to meet. We also collect information about your use of our services such as access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access 
    our services through your social media account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your profile. If you want additional info, 
    we go into more detail below.</p>
<h4 class="para">Information you give us</h4>
<p class="para">You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p>
 <ul style="list-style: inside disc;">
<li class="para">When you create an account, you provide us with at least your phone number and email address, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, 
    such as your gender, date of birth, and who you’d like to connect with.</li>
<li class="para">When you complete your profile, you have the option to share your sexual orientation with us. Where you provide such elements to us, you consent to us using it 
    for the purposes identified and as laid out in this Privacy Policy. You can also share additional information with us, such as details on your bio and your interests, 
    as well as content such as photos and videos. To add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.</li>
<li class="para">When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us with information 
    related to the purchases you make and our payment processors with information such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.</li>
<li class="para">When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.</li>
<li class="para">When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.</li>
<li class="para">If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction.</li>
<li class="para">If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a given feature), we process this information on your 
    behalf in order to complete your request.</li>
<li class="para">Of course, we also process your chats with other members as well as the content you publish to operate and secure the services, and to keep our community safe.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="para">Information we receive from others</h4>
<p class="para">In addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</p>
 <ul style="list-style: inside disc;">
<li class="para"><strong>Members:</strong> Members may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.</li>
<li class="para"><strong>Social Media:</strong> You may decide to share information with us through your social media account, for instance if you decide to create and log into your 
    account via your social media or other account (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or to upload onto our services information such as photos from one of your social media 
    accounts (e.g., Instagram or Spotify).</li>
<li class="para"><strong>Affiliates:</strong> We are part of the 34th Company family of businesses. 34th Company considers the safety and security of
     members a top priority. If you were banned from another 34th Company service, your information can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing 
     your account or preventing you from creating an account on our services. </li>
<li class="para"><strong>Other Partners:</strong> We may receive information about you from our partners where our ads are published on a partner’s service (in which case they may pass along 
    details on a campaign’s success). Where legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to 
    ensure our members’ safety and security.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="para">Information generated or automatically collected when you use our services</h4>
<p class="para">When you use our services, this generates technical data about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the devices you use to access our services. See below for more details.</p>
 <ul style="list-style: inside disc;">
<li class="para"><strong>Usage Information:</strong> Using the services generates data about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., when you logged in, 
    features you’ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other members 
    (e.g., members you connect and interact with, and when you matched and exchanged messages with them).</li>
<li class="para"><strong>Device information:</strong> We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as 
    IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device’ 
    settings and, in some cases, disable entirely), and identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.</li>

<p class="para"><strong>Information collected by cookies and similar technologies:</strong> We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels, SDKs) 
    to recognize you and/or your device(s). You may read our <a href="cookie.html">Cookie Policy</a> for more information on why we use them and how you can better control their use.</p>
<p class="para">Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or 
    her online activity tracked. If a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the 
    browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many businesses, including ours, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>


<p class="para"><strong>Other information with your consent:</strong></p>
 <ul style="list-style: inside disc;">
<li class="para"><strong>Precise geolocation data:</strong> If you give us your consent, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) from your device. The collection of your 
    geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline permission for us 
    to collect your precise geolocation, we will not collect it, and our services that rely on precise geolocation may not be available to you.</li>
<li class="para"><strong>Photo Verification</strong> <strong>data:</strong> If you choose to participate in our Photo Verification feature, we collect your face geometry data, which may be considered
     biometric data in some jurisdictions, to verify that you’re the real you. You can learn more about Photo Verification and how we process your face geometry data.</li>
<li class="para"><strong>Other information:</strong> We may collect other information with your permission, such as photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish 
    a photo or video or participate in streaming features on our services).</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 class="para"><a name="how-we-share-info"></a> 5. How We Share Information</h3>

     members’ information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other 34th Company companies for specified reasons as laid out 
     below and, in some cases, legal authorities. Read on for more details about how your information is shared with others.</p>
 <ul style="list-style: inside disc;">

<h4 class="para">With other members</h4>

    For instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising vendors.</p>

    assistance, improving our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings</li>
<li class="para">We may also share information with other 34th Company companies for other legitimate business purposes including corporate audit, analysis and consolidated

    law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or 
    (iii) to protect the safety of any person.</p>


<h4 class="para">To enforce legal rights</h4>

    legal rights of our members, business partners or other interested parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other 
    action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</p>


<h4 class="para">With your consent or at your request</h4>
<p class="para">We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.</p>

</ul>
<p class="para">We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, 
    general behavioral data, location in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances. 
    We may also share this information with other 34th Company companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services 
    and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine this information with additional non-personal information 
    or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources. More information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our 
    <a href="cookie.html">Cookie Policy</a></p>

<p class="para">Sharing of information laid out in Section 5 involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different 
    laws about data processing. When we transfer personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries which data protection laws 
    have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental body, 
    we use <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">standard contract clauses</a> 
    (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or other appropriate 
    transfer mechanism. We are currently in the process of reviewing transfers to our vendors and associated legal basis further to the

 <ul style="list-style: inside disc;">
<li class="para"><u>Access / Update tools in the service.</u> Tools and account settings can help you access, rectify or remove information that you provided to us and that’s 
    associated with your account directly within the service. If you have any questions on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help.</li>
<li class="para"><u>Device permissions.</u> Mobile platforms can have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone contacts, pictures, 
    location services, push notifications and advertising identifiers. You can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection or processing 
    of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose functionality.</li>
<li class="para"><u>Uninstall.</u> You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device. Remember that uninstalling
     an app does NOT close your account. To close your account, please use the corresponding functionality on the service.</li>
<li class="para"><u>Account closure.</u> You can close your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">We also want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Depending on where you live, you may have the right to:</p>
 <ul style="list-style: inside disc;">
<li class="para"><u>Access/know.</u> You may have the right to request a copy of the information we keep about you, and in certain circumstances to receive this in a portable format. 
    You can exercise your right to access directly within the service by putting in a request.</li>
<li class="para"><u>Delete/erase.</u> You may request that we delete the personal information we keep about you. You can exercise your right to delete by submitting a request.</li>
<li class="para"><u>Correct/rectify/update.</u> You can correct most information you provided to us by editing your profile directly in the service. 
    If you believe the information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may contact us to rectify it.</li>
<li class="para"><u>Object/restrict.</u> You may also have the right to object to or request that we restrict certain processing. To do so, please contact us.</li>
</ul>
<p class="para">For your protection and the protection of all of our members, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests. Keep in mind, we may reject requests, 
    including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other 
    rights of someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another member, such as a copy of any messages you received from them through our service, the other member 
    will have to contact us to provide their written consent before the information is released. We may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request.
     Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide 
     our service to you anymore. For instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot ensure that you are 18 years of age or older.</p>

    authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. You can find information about your data protection regulator in 
    the European Economic Area <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">here</a>, and in the United Kingdom <a href="https://ico.org.uk/">here</a>.

<h3 class="para"><a name="how-long-we-retain"></a> 8. How Long We Retain Your Information</h3>
<p class="para">We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 4) and as permitted by applicable law. 
    If you decide to stop using our services, you can close your account and your profile will stop being visible to other members. Note that we will close your account 
    automatically if you are inactive for a period of two years. After your account is closed, we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:</p>
 <ol>
<li class="para">To protect the safety and security of our members, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure, or one year following an account ban. 
    During this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this
     safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.</li>
<li class="para">
<p class="para">Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below:</p>
 <ul style="list-style: none;">
<li class="para">a) We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 
    10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, credit card information for the duration the user may challenge the transaction and “traffic data” / 
    logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents members give us for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law.</li>
<li class="para">b) We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting 
    data as well as imprecise location of download/purchase for five years to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights 
    and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, information on the existence of past accounts and subscriptions, which 
    we delete three years after the closure of your last account to ensure proper and accurate financial forecasting and reporting, 
    profile data for one year in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, and 
    data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account, for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.</li>
<li class="para">c) Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or 
    dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case 
    we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="para"><a name="childrens-privacy"></a> 9. No Children Allowed</h3>
<p class="para">Our services are restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform. If you

<h3 class="para"><a name="job-candidates"></a> 10. Job Candidates, Contractors and Vendor Representatives</h3>
<p class="para">We process the personal information of our job candidates, contractors and vendor representatives, as part of our recruitment and talent management 
    operations and our management of the services that contractors and vendors provide to us. If you are a job candidate, contractor or vendor representative
     of ours, certain relevant terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your personal information, including the sections of this Privacy Policy 
     that discuss the <a href="privacy.html">entity that is responsible for the processing of your personal information</a>, <a href="privacy.html">transfers of

<p class="para">If you are a job applicant, the personal information we process about you may vary depending on the job you seek but typically includes what you provide to us as 
    part of your job application as well as professional qualifications, background and reference information that recruiters or other third parties share with us. 
    We use this information to support the recruitment process, which may lead to an employment contract. For contractors and vendor representatives, we may process 
    identification information and work-related information, as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer, which is necessary for the performance 
    of the services agreement, and to establish, exercise or defend potential legal claims. We may share personal information with service providers that assist us with 
    recruitment and technical data processing operations as well as with 34th Company companies (for instance if you have a business 
    relationship with employees of an affiliate). We keep your personal information only as long as necessary for those purposes.</p>
<h3 class="para"><a name="policy-changes"></a> 11. Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
