        </h1>
        
        <p class="para">Last revised on November 19, 2021</p>

        <p class="para">Key change in this version: We’ve clarified that 34th Company Technology Services Limited, which operates our European Headquarters, is responsible for our service in the 
        European Economic Area, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.</p>

        <p class="para">For a summary of our Terms of Use, go to Summary of Terms.</p>

        <p class="para">Welcome to LoveMatch. If you live in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, these Terms of Use are between you and:</p>

        <p class="para">34th Company Technology Services Limited ("34th Company Technology") WeWork Charlemont Exchange 42 Charlemont Street Dublin 2, D02 R593 Ireland</p>

        <p class="para">If you live in Japan, these Terms of Use apply between you and:</p>

        <p class="para">MG Japan Services GK (“MG Japan”) 4F Sumitomo Fudosan Azabu Bldg 1-4-1 Mita Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-0073 Japan</p>

        <p class="para">34th Company, LLC ("34th Company") 8750 North Central Expressway, Suite 1400 Dallas, TX 75231, USA</p>

        <p class="para">The terms (“us”, “we”, the “Company” or “LoveMatch”) refer to 34th Company Technology, MG Japan or 34th Company based on your country of residence.</p>

        <h2 class="para" >1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement.</h2>
        <p class="para">By creating a LoveMatch account, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these 
            Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Arbitration Procedures (if applicable to you), Safety Tips, and Community Guidelines, each of which 
            is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services 
            we offer on the Service (collectively, this "Agreement"). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Service.</p>

        <p class="para"> We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to time. 
            We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. 
            The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under Settings and also on goLoveMatch.com, and you should regularly check for the most recent version. 
            The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes to your rights or obligations, 
            we will notify you at least 30 days in advance of the changes (unless we’re unable to do so under applicable law) by reasonable means, 
            which could include notification through the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.
        </p>
        <h2 class="para">2. Eligibility.</h2>
        <p class="para">
            You are not authorized to create an account or access or use the Service or systems it resides on unless all of the following are true:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: inside disc;">
            <li class="para">you are at least 18 years of age.</li>
            <li class="para">you can form a binding contract with LoveMatch,</li>
            <li class="para">you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction 
                (for example, you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition),</li>
            <li class="para">you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations, and</li>
            <li class="para">you have never been convicted of a felony or indictable offense (or crime of similar severity), a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, 
                and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="para">3. Your Account.</h2>
        <p class="para">In order to use LoveMatch, you may sign in using a number of ways, including by Facebook login. 
            If you choose to use your Facebook login, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information, including but not limited to your public Facebook profile. 
            For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p class="para">You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up for LoveMatch, 
            and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials. If you think someone has gained access to your account, please immediately contact us.
        </p>

<h2 class="para">4. Modifying the Service and Termination.</h2>
<p class="para">LoveMatch is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. 
    This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, 
    we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, 
    such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.</p>
<p class="para">The easiest way to terminate your account is to follow the instructions under "Settings" in the Service. 
    Of course, you retain other termination options. However, if you use a third party payment account such as Apple’s App Store or iTunes Store, 
    as applicable (“App Store”) or the Google Play Store, you will need to manage in app purchases through such an account to avoid additional billing. 
    LoveMatch may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, 
    you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases.</p>
<p class="para">For residents of the Republic of Korea, except in the case where we reasonably consider that (i) giving notice is legally prohibited 
    (for instance, when providing notice would either violate applicable laws, regulations, or orders from regulatory authorities or compromise an ongoing 
    investigation conducted by a regulatory authority) or (ii) any notice may cause harm to you, third parties, LoveMatch, and/or our affiliates 
    (for instance, when providing notice harms the security of the Service), we will without delay notify you of the reason for taking the relevant step.</p>

<p class="para">After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and LoveMatch: 
    Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.</p>

    <h2 class="para">5. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Members.</h2>
    <p class="para">Though LoveMatch strives to encourage a respectful member experience through features like the double opt-in that allows members to communicate only 
        after they have both indicated interest in one another, LoveMatch is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of the Service. 
        You agree to use caution in all interactions with other members, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. 
        In addition, you agree to review and follow LoveMatch’s Safety Tips prior to using the Service. You agree that you will not provide your financial 
        information (for example, your credit card or bank account information), or wire or otherwise send money to other members.</p>

        <p class="para">YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS. 
            YOU UNDERSTAND THAT LoveMatch DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS MEMBERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS MEMBERS. 
            LoveMatch MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OR COMPATIBILITY OF MEMBERS.</p>

        <h2 class="para">6. Rights LoveMatch Grants You.</h2>
        <p class="para">LoveMatch grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Service. 
            This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Service’s benefits as intended by LoveMatch and permitted by this Agreement.

            <p class="para">LoveMatch may investigate and take any available legal action in response to illegal or unauthorized uses of the Service, including termination of your account.</p>

            <p class="para">Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. 
                You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device's settings.</p>

                <h2 class="para">7. Rights you Grant LoveMatch.</h2>
                <p class="para">By creating an account, you grant to LoveMatch a worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host, store, use, copy, display, 
reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify and distribute information you authorize us to access from third parties such as Facebook, as well as any information you post, 
upload, display or otherwise make available (collectively, "post") on the Service or transmit to other members (collectively, "Content"). LoveMatch's license to your 
Content shall be non-exclusive, except that LoveMatch's license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of the Service. For example, 
LoveMatch would have an exclusive license to screenshots of the Service that include your Content. In addition, so that LoveMatch can prevent the use of your Content 
outside of the Service, you authorize LoveMatch to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other members or third parties. 
This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if your Content is 
taken and used by third parties outside of the Service. Our license to your Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding personal data protection 
to the extent any Content contains personal information as defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and 
researching and developing new ones. You agree that any Content you place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed by other members and may be viewed by any person 
visiting or participating in the Service (such as individuals who may receive shared Content from other LoveMatch members).</p>

<p class="para">You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your account, including information submitted from your Facebook account, 
    is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the Content on the Service and grant the license to LoveMatch above.</p>

    <p class="para">You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you post as part of a Service. 
        We may delete any Content, in whole or in part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm the reputation of the Service.</p>

        <p class="para">When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. 
            If we feel that your behavior towards any of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening, harassing, or offensive, 
            we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account.</p>

            <p class="para">In consideration for LoveMatch allowing you to use the Service, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place 
                advertising on the Service. By submitting suggestions or feedback to LoveMatch regarding our Service, you agree that LoveMatch may use and share such 
                feedback for any purpose without compensating you.</p>

                <p class="para">Please be informed that LoveMatch may access, store and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law, 
                    by performing its agreement with you, or in a good faith belief that such access, storage or disclosure satisfies a legitimate interest, including to: 
                    (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; 
                    (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.</p>
