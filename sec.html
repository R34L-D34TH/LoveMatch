<p class="para"><strong>Red Team / Offensive Security:</strong> Our internal Red Team identifies previously unknown security 
    vulnerabilities in existing systems and workflows through offensive security testing. This group simulates

    greatest risk. Our goal is to gain insight into potential exposures, and to continuously test to reduce the likelihood of a breach.</p>
