        <p class="para">Welcome to the LoveMatch community. If you’re honest, kind and respectful to others, you’ll always be welcome here. 
            If you choose not to be, you may not last. Our goal is to allow users to express themselves freely as long as it doesn’t offend others. 
            Everyone is held to the same standard on LoveMatch. We’re asking you to be considerate, think before you act, and abide by our community 
            guidelines both on and offline. You heard that right: your offline behavior can lead to termination of your LoveMatch account.</p>
        <p class="para">Below is a list of our community policies. If you violate any of these policies, you might be banned from LoveMatch. 
            Seriously, don’t make us Swipe Left on you—because there will be no do-overs once we do. We encourage you to report
             any behavior that violates our policies, and read up on our <a href="safety.html">Safety Tips</a>.</p>
        <h2>LoveMatch is not for:</h2>
        <p class="para"><strong>Nudity/Sexual Content</strong></p>
        <p class="para">We’re not asking you to comb your hair to one side or even speak in full sentences; 
            but please keep it classy and appropriate for public consumption. No nudity, no sexually explicit content, 
            and don’t chronicle all of your sexual desires in your bio. Keep it clean.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Harassment</strong></p>
        <p class="para">Do not engage, or encourage others to engage, in any targeted abuse or harassment against any other user. 
            This includes sending any unsolicited sexual content to your matches. Reports of stalking, threats, bullying, or intimidation, are taken very seriously.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Violence and Physical Harm</strong></p>
        <p class="para">We do not tolerate violent, graphic, or gory content on LoveMatch, or any actions or content that 
            advocate for or threaten violence of any sort, including threatening or promoting terrorism. Physical assault, 
            coercion, and any acts of violence are strictly prohibited.</p>
        <p class="para">Content that advocates for or glorifies suicide or self-harm is also not allowed. 
            In these situations, we may take a number of steps to assist the user, including reaching out with crisis resources.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Hate Speech</strong></p>
        <p class="para">Any content that promotes, advocates for, or condones racism, bigotry, hatred, or violence against 
            individuals or groups based on factors like (but not limited to) race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, disability, 
            gender, age, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity is not allowed.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Private Information</strong></p>
        <p class="para">Don’t publicly broadcast any private information, yours or anyone else’s. 
            This includes social security numbers, passports, passwords, financial information or unlisted contact 
            information, such as phone numbers, email addresses, home/work address.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Spam</strong></p>
        <p class="para">Don’t be fake. Be real instead. Don’t use LoveMatch to drive people to external websites via a link or otherwise.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Promotion or Solicitation</strong></p>
        <p class="para">Soliciting other users is prohibited on LoveMatch. It’s fine to invite your matches to 
            something that you’re doing, but if the purpose of your profile is to advertise your event or business, 
            non-profit, political campaign, contest, or to conduct research, we may delete your account. While 
            we’re excited that you’re doing a comedy show next week, please don’t use LoveMatch to promote it.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Prostitution and Trafficking</strong></p>
        <p class="para">Promoting or advocating for commercial sexual services, human trafficking or other 
            non-consensual sexual acts is strictly prohibited and will result in your account being banned from LoveMatch.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Scamming</strong></p>
        <p class="para">LoveMatch has a zero-tolerance policy on predatory behavior of any kind. Anyone attempting to get other 
            users’ private information for fraudulent or illegal activity may be banned. Any user caught sharing their own financial 
            account information (PayPal, Venmo, etc.) for the purpose of receiving money from other users may also be banned from LoveMatch.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Impersonation</strong></p>
        <p class="para">Be yourself! Don’t pretend to be someone else.</p>
        <p class="para">Do not impersonate, or otherwise misrepresent affiliation, connection or association with, any 
            person or entity. This includes parody accounts. While we think your Mike Pence profile is hilarious, you aren’t 
            Mike Pence. And if you are, what are you doing on LoveMatch?</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Minors</strong></p>
        <p class="para">You must be 18 years of age or older to use LoveMatch. As such, we do not allow images of 
            unaccompanied minors. If you want to post photos of your children, please make sure that you are in the 
            photo as well. If you see a profile that includes an unaccompanied minor, encourages harm to a minor, or 
            depicts a minor in a sexual or suggestive way, please report it immediately.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Copyright and Trademark Infringement</strong></p>
        <p class="para">If it’s not yours, don’t post it. If your LoveMatch profile includes any work that is 
            copyrighted or trademarked by others, don’t display it, unless you are allowed to do so.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Illegal Usage</strong></p>
        <p class="para">Don’t use LoveMatch to do anything illegal. If it’s illegal IRL, it’s illegal on LoveMatch.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>One Person, One Account</strong></p>
        <p class="para">LoveMatch accounts cannot have multiple owners, so don’t create an account with your friend 
            or significant other. Additionally, please don’t maintain multiple LoveMatch accounts.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Third Party Apps</strong></p>
        <p class="para">The use of any apps created by anyone other than LoveMatch that claim to offer our service or 
            unlock special LoveMatch features (like auto-swipers) is not allowed.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Account Dormancy</strong></p>
        <p class="para">LoveMatch is fun to use... all the time! Use LoveMatch at the lake, use LoveMatch while eating 
            cake. Use LoveMatch when you’re out, use LoveMatch when in doubt! But, if you don’t log in to your LoveMatch 
            account in 2 years, we may delete your account for inactivity.</p>
